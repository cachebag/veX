**veX** is a 2D platformer game built using C++ and the SFML library.

## Progress Check

- [X] Basic player movement
- [X] Collision detection
- [ ] Level design implementation
- [ ] Sprite art for character(s)
- [ ] Core game mechanics (level passthrough, life/death, etc.)

### Notes
- Next steps will be to lock down and refine the level design and basic player movement, create the art and define our player's full purpose and draw out the key mappings.
