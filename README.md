**veX** is a 2D platformer game built using C++ and the SFML library.

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher
- SFML 2.5.1 or newer

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies (SFML)
3. Compile using your preferred IDE or command line

## Progress Check

- [X] Basic player movement
- [X] Collision detection
- [ ] Level design implementation
- [ ] Sprite art for character(s)
